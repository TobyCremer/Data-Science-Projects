66,"16 year old Lagavulin double-matured in ex-bodega Pedro Ximenez cask wood for an intense, raisiny sweetness that marries beautifully with the smoky power of the regular release to create a massive, rich tasting power-house of a malt. Crafted with passion and skill on historic Lagavulin Bay since 1816, iconic Lagavulin Single Malt Scotch Whisky celebrated its 200th anniversary in 2016 and is for many the pinnacle of Islay malts; intense in flavour, smoky and rich.
It’s quite a legacy to carry in a bay enshrouded by the mists of time, a bay from which the sons of Somerled, Lord of the Isles, sailed to war; a bay guarded still by his ruined castle, Dunyvaig. Barley malted over local peat smoke imbues Lagavulin with its rich mix of shoreline airs and scented, smoky dryness.
Here’s a whisky so intense it turns away the cold; “time”, say locals, “takes out the fire and leaves in the warmth”. All this might please at last the leader who brought Lagavulin to fame, Sir Peter Mackie, known as “Restless Peter”.

71,"The first-ever Inchgower Special Release in this series is a complex, surprising whisky from a distillery with a heart-warming back story, which starts sweetly then becomes crisply aromatic and drying with a beautiful bitter-sweet drying finish. The romantic story of Inchgower begins with a famous predecessor. Tochieneal distillery was built nearby in 1824 by local factor, Alexander Wilson. His nephew, also Alexander but known to all as 'Uncle Sandy', developed its fame but had to close it in 1870, when a proposed doubling of the rent made distilling uneconomic. The water supply, too, had reached its limit as sales of Tochieneal grew. The happy outcome was the building in 1871 of the new Inchgower distillery just outside Buckie, the port closest to the mouth of the River Spey. Men who spent their working lives with 'Uncle Sandy‘ recorded the move in the poem “Tochieneal”. Made near the sea, the whisky is rarely seen as a Single Malt and excitingly different for
a Speyside, enjoying a crisp, aromatic style that has led to its being nicknamed “the Manzanilla of Speyside”, after the Sherry with a similarly distinctive style.",Single Malt Scotch Whisky,700,Speyside,30.2,55.3,Scotland,27 Year Old,Inchgower,,

167,"The first of thirteen annual releases in this series to combine refill and rejuvenated American oak hogsheads and ex-bodega European oak
butts. An exceptionally grown up whisky with a powerful and persuasive flavour profile that could only be a Caol Ila. Established in 1846, Caol Ila is hidden away in a tiny bay near Port Askaig on the Sound of Islay (in Gaelic, Caol Ila). A nearby water supply was one reason for the remote site; a waterfall even supplied power for the barley hoists and pressure for the fire hydrants. Until the early 1960s casks left Caol Ila and supplies arrived by sea. Rebuilt as a new distillery and significantly extended to six stills in 1972, Caol Ila became the largest distillery on Islay yet its single malts remained almost unknown until 2002, when an award-winning range was
introduced. This is in many ways a connoisseur’s Islay malt; despite being less well known than their southern siblings, its whiskies are every bit as capable of fine complexity, balanced and distinctive in fresh aromas and taste, with great character and depth at any age.",Single Malt Scotch Whisky,700,Islay,32.63,59.1,Scotland,15 Year Old,Caol Ila,cork,Single Malt

Complex and compelling; light and straightforward, yet also full-flavoured and forceful. Opened in 1975, Pittyvaich was one of the shortest-lived distilleries ever built on Speyside; the innocent victim of industry restructuring, it closed in 1993 through no fault of its whisky and has long since been demolished. Unsurprisingly, its pleasing single malt has never been widely available, though it has been proven to age well; none younger than 25 years of age remains. Most closed distilleries have produced for decades, even centuries before their closure, but
Pittyvaich lived for a mere eighteen years. The name is Gaelic and may refer to an early dwelling on the site, a ‘farmstead at the birch wood’. The distillery was, however, an impressive and ultramodern state of the art building, built around stills that were an exact replica of those at Dufftown, then its sister distillery.

Colour: Rich amber gold
Nose: Silky vanilla and honey with hints of ginger

412,"The Tullibardine 25 has been matured for a minimum of 25 years in ex-sherry hogsheads. It is beautifully aged, with wonderful hues of red, orange and brown.
Amazingly, no oaky notes appear at all for a whisky of this age. Instead, you’ll discover subtle vanilla, toffee and orange chocolate.

The 'Sienna', exclusively matured in sherry oaks casks, brings subtle notes of vanilla, zest and fresh green apples.
